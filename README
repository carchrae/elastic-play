This Play Framework module creates an embedded Elastic Search instance inside a Play application.

Key Features:

* Fully embedded Elastic Search node
* Exposed Elastic Search API through Play Routing (easily create a secured Elastic Search instance)
* Using the S3 Gateway, you can run Elastic Search nodes on Heroku and save state to an S3 bucket.

Limitations:

* Elastic Search supports a GET with a body.  Play! does not support this.  Please use the same commands using POST.

Design Goals:

Care has been taken to provide a very loose coupling between Elastic Search and your Play application.  This allows you to use Elastic Search in whatever capacity you require without presuming any particular structure on your model.

A sample application is included that shows how Elastic Search could be used.
